# Marked Themes

## about

Some CSS for the [Marked][] markdown processor.

[Marked]: http://markedapp.com

Includes the [scss][] I wrote as well as the css it compiles into, which marked uses.

[scss]: http://sass-lang.com

With the `config.rb` file and the way the folders are organized, you can just run `compass watch` and modify the scss files and the css files will be automatically updated.

## examples

### Prose (aka the only one)

It's nice for writing fiction.

* paragraphs are indented like in books, where the first paragraph of a section is not indented. I wrote about why I like this [here](http://www.maxjacobson.net/2012-03-21-indenting-paragraphs-online).
* includes some google web fonts
* responsive
* cool horizontal rule w/ unicode symbols (v literary looking) which I wrote about [here](http://www.maxjacobson.net/2012-12-31-the-horizontal-rule)
